	 * 
	 * Several "goofy" conventions include using "http://". Of course, it's not
	 * a URI, but most programmers would think it is a URI, so to prevent
	 * someone from attempting to actually use it as a URI, they code any "dots"
	 * inside "path" backwards.
	 * 
	 * i.e. "http://csi.cingular.com/CSI..."
	 * 
	 * However, it has become a convention if you end up using "http" in your
	 * namespace.
	 * 
	 * On the other hand, there is actually no reason to put "http://" in your
	 * namespace, and other nicer "conventions" have arisen, including using
	 * "java:com.cingular.csi", which actually looks like a java path, and just
	 * "com.cingular.csi", which is just as valid.
	 * 
	 * There is no telling what kind of additional "goofiness" will be found in
	 * the company and vendors of ATT,so we reserve the ability to code this
	 * within M2E in a convenient place.
